# Wine Quality ML Regression Models

A comparison of seven machine learning models including linear regression, poisson regression, negative binomial regression, zero-inflated poisson, zero-inflated negative binomial, and a hurdle model. All models use a public dataset from UCI based on expert wine ratings using a score between 0 - 10 and many different attributes around the wine's chemical and physical composition. The script is written using an R Markdown file and contains a detailed explanation of each section of the script.
